# Browser Proof Generation

This is an experiment for generating the ZK proof in the user's browser. 

### Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Navigate into the `zkeys` folder and run a local server to serve the wasm and zkey file. `npx http-server --cors -p 8000`
3. In a separate terminal, `npm run serve` to start the frontend.
